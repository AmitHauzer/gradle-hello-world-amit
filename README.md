# Tasks
```

- gradle-hello-world.jar - this is regular jar, it contains only the project's classes.
```

```

# CI/CD Workflows

This repository includes two GitHub Actions workflows that operate based on the branch being updated:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    a[docker build and run check]--> q{is it master?} --> |No| End;
    q{is it master?} --> |Yes| b[download docker image and run] --> c[commit the new version] --> End;
```

1. **Master Branch Workflow:**
   - **Trigger:** Runs only on the `master` branch.
   - **Actions:**
     - **Docker Build and run:** Builds a Docker image, runs test, and tags the image with the new version and latest.
     - **Docker push:** Pushes the images to Docker Hub.
     - **Download the docker image:** Pulles the new image and runs!
     - **Version Update:** Automatically increments the patch portion of the JAR version (e.g., `1.0.0` â†’ `1.0.1`).

2. **Non-Master Branch Workflow:**
   - **Trigger:** Runs on all branches except `master`.
   - **Actions:**
     - **Docker Build:** Builds a Docker image for testing purposes.
     - **Run container:** tests the container.
